Developed a 3D Unity project using the Universal Render Pipeline, featuring custom player controls and interaction scripts. Demonstrated knowledge of Unity scripting, asset integration, and scene setup. Project showcases proficiency with C# and real-time 3D workflows.

- Custom player controller (movement, camera, breathing, sprint)
- Scene setup and lighting using URP
- Example integration of Unity scripting (C#)
- (Optional) Demo scenes/asset packs, which have been excluded due to licensing
